                <img src="Netflix clone.png" alt="" class="site">
                <h1>Netflix clone</h1>
                <p>A Netflix clone created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs is a web-based application designed to mimic the core features of the popular streaming service, Netflix. This project is an excellent way to learn and demonstrate skills in frontend development and API integration.</p>
                <li><b style="color:black">HTML:</b> Used to structure the basic layout of the application, including navigation bars, a main content area for video display, and sections for different categories of videos like "New Releases," "Trending Now," and "Watch Again."</li>
                <li><b style="color:black">CSS:</b> Styles the application to look visually appealing and similar to Netflix's sleek, modern design. CSS is used to manage layouts, colors, fonts, and responsive design features that ensure the site works on devices of all sizes.</li>
                <li><b style="color:black">JavaScript:</b> Adds interactivity to the clone. JavaScript is used for handling user inputs, such as clicking on a movie thumbnail to play a trailer or navigating through different categories. JavaScript also dynamically updates the HTML content based on user interaction and data received from the server.</li>
                <li><b style="color:black">API Fetching in JavaScript:</b> The clone uses JavaScript to fetch data from movie database APIs like The Movie Database (TMDB) API. This is crucial for populating the clone with real movie and TV show data, including titles, images, descriptions, and possibly even video trailers. API calls are made using AJAX, Fetch API, or other methods to retrieve JSON data and then dynamically update the webpage without reloading.</li>

                <li><b style="color:black">HTML:</b> Structures the basic layout of the game, including elements such as buttons for each choice (stone, paper, scissors), a section to display the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game.</li>
                <li><b style="color:black">CSS:</b> Styles the game to make it visually appealing and engaging. CSS is used to design buttons, add animations, and format text and layouts so that the game is responsive and works well on different devices.</li>
                <li><b style="color:black">JavaScript:</b> Adds the interactivity needed for the game mechanics. JavaScript handles user inputs (the player’s choice) and generates the computer's random choice. It also contains the logic to determine the winner based on the rules (rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock). After each round, JavaScript updates the webpage to show the choices made, the outcome of the round, and updates the score.</li>
                <br><hr>
                <p>The game typically starts with a welcome screen, followed by the main interactive area where the player selects their option. The computer's choice is generated randomly. The results are then compared, and the webpage is updated to display who won that round along with the current score. </p>

                <p>A temperature converter created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple web-based application designed to convert temperatures between different scales, commonly Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This utility helps users quickly perform temperature conversions, useful in many educational, scientific, and cooking contexts.</p>
                <li><b style="color:black">HTML:</b> Structures the basic layout of the application. This includes input fields for the user to enter a temperature, radio buttons or a dropdown menu to select the input and output temperature scales, and a button to perform the conversion.</li>
                <li><b style="color:black">CSS:</b> Styles the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. CSS is used to design the layout, spacing, colors, and fonts, making the converter easy to navigate and pleasant to use. Responsive design practices ensure that the converter works well on both desktops and mobile devices.</li>
                <li><b style="color:black">JavaScript:</b> Adds interactivity to the application. JavaScript is responsible for handling user inputs, performing the conversion calculations based on the selected scales, and displaying the conversion results. <span style="color:black">The logic involves:</span>
                    <li style="color:black"">Reading the input temperature and the selected scales from the user input.</li>
                    <li style="color:black">Calculating the converted temperature using the appropriate formulas (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Kelvin, etc.).</li>
                    <li style="color:black">Outputting the result dynamically on the webpage without reloading.</li>

                <p>A student management system created using Python is a software application designed to handle various administrative tasks related to students in an educational institution. This system can efficiently manage student information, grades, attendance, and other educational and administrative details. Python, known for its simplicity and readability, is often chosen for such systems because it allows for rapid development and easy maintenance. Stores and retrieves comprehensive data on students, such as names, addresses, parental contacts, and medical information. Allows for recording, updating, and tracking student grades and academic performance over time. It might include functionalities to calculate averages, generate report cards, and provide statistical academic insights. Manages courses offered, including scheduling, teacher assignments, and enrollment options.</p>
                <li>Uses a database system like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL to store and manage all the data securely. Python's libraries such as SQLAlchemy or the SQLite3 module can be used to interface with these databases.</li>

                <img src="Toggle-Eye.png" alt="" class="site">
                <h1>Toggle-Eye</h1>
                <p>A "Toggle Eye" project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is designed to allow users to switch between dark mode and light mode on a webpage. This feature enhances user experience by offering a visually comfortable browsing environment in various lighting conditions. Dark mode reduces the light emitted by device screens while maintaining the minimum color contrast ratios required for readability, which is preferable in low-light conditions. Conversely, light mode is better suited for bright environments.</p>
                <li><b style="color:black">HTML:</b> Structures the basic elements of the webpage, including the toggle switch that users interact with to change the theme. This might be implemented as a simple button, a checkbox, or a custom-designed toggle switch.</li>
                <li><b style="color:black">CSS:</b> Defines the styles for both the light mode and the dark mode. This includes background colors, text colors, button styles, and other elements that change appearance based on the selected mode. CSS variables can be particularly useful here, as they allow you to easily switch values for various properties based on the current theme.</li>
                <li><b style="color:black">JavaScript</b>: Adds the functionality to the toggle switch. When the toggle is activated (e.g., clicked by the user), JavaScript dynamically changes the styles of the webpage elements by altering the CSS classes applied to the body of the document or by switching the values of CSS variables. This change can be animated for a smoother transition effect.</li>
